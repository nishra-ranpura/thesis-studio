Looking for insights for the pathway this thesis seems to be going into, I turn towards conversations with certain cross-disciplinary artists/experts/practitioners about their journey, challenges, methods and other general experiences.

An intellectual conversation, a pleasant lunch and a studio visit with [Suzanne Kite](https://digitalarchives.library.newschool.edu/index.php/Detail/objects/PC020402_2020_amgab699){:target="_blank"} (Oglála Lakȟóta performance artist)...

- Made me think about Subjective and Multiple interpretations of cultural beliefs and how to process it alongside emerging technologies, while talking about the artist’s experience with indegenous community
- Made me look into the notion of intelligences as more than human and mechanical, such as ones of the intelligence of rocks or elements of nature.
-Led us to talk about receiving critical and constructive feedback and processing it in a cross-disciplinary and novel arenas.
- Brought forth the dialogue about this idea of existence and relationship with technology in a diverse manner, the conversation referencing to- animisim and shinto religion’s concepts about spirits, Indians (Asian-Indians) blessing and worshiping machines, ceremonial technologies, power and limitation of superstition and more.
- Led us to talk about phenomenological research and the ethnographers’ challenges of filtering facts versus lies, and comparing them with cultural myths versus intentional misleadings. 
- Brought up references such as GAN Deep Learning, [Dr. Fox Harrell](https://www.csail.mit.edu/person/d-fox-harrell){:target="_blank"}’s research, and [Jason Edward Lewis](https://jasonlewis.org/){:target="_blank"}’s works

A friendly call with [Melanie Olde](https://www.melanieolde.com/){:target="_blank"} (Handweaver)...

- Helped me think about more practical implementations of moving textiles (soft robotics, shape memory alloys and more, 3D fabrics)
Provoked me to think about responsiveness of a textile and the intent behind the response, and the intent behind manufacturing of response
- Brought forth pragmatic applications of tech-textiles, such as medical grafting with 3D weaving, military applications around body armor technologies, and “mad and wonderful stuff” in aeronautics
- Led us to talk about the artist’s interests in biomimicry and geometry in 3D weaving inspired from plant and cellular cell structure 
- Encouraged me to use the opportunity of a Masters to explore rather than think about limitations and applications
- Was encouraging in enjoying the journey of experimentation
- Made me wonder about the energies while interacting with fabrics
- Was certainly a lot about affinity with fellow weavers
- Brought forth, discussion about open source weaving software such as [TexGen](http://texgen.sourceforge.net/index.php/Main_Page){:target="_blank"} and [Ada Cad](https://adacad-weaver.firebaseapp.com/){:target="_blank"}

An informative conversation with [Tatsuki Hayama](https://tomoe.me/){:target="_blank"} (Mathematician) 
- Was all about our contradictory experiences of approaching this intersection of Textiles and Computation, and how the challenges lie in different things when approached from the perspective of a mathematical versus a textile designer.
- Was also about tools of deep learning and tools of fabrication
- Got us more into detail about technical specifications of Jacquard applications and multi-layer fabric
- Was an interesting dialogue around similarities and differences of weaving and coding language

An enlightening, captivating, and provocative dialogue with [Annet Couwenberg](http://www.annetcouwenberg.com/){:target="_blank"} (Author, Educator, and Artist around FIber and Material Studies)...
- Was around philosophies of what technology is, and the significance of tools, from a needle to a loom and a computer in being part of a technology
- Was about significance of teaching the values of making and meaning of technologies
- Helped me frame and structure my portrayal of thesis and how to put forward the message I am trying to have
- Brought forth the significance of “showing the work” in a world today where everything is about being hidden in the name of clean technologies
- Led me to contemplate the importance of tradition in innovation 
- Made me think about the processes and acts of making as exchange of information
- Was a lot about the role of women and feminism in innovation ([The Computer pays its debt](https://www.centerforcraft.org/exhibition/the-computer-pays-its-debt-women-textiles-and-technology-1965-1985){:target="_blank"})
- Was also a lot about intersection of philosophy and making, embodied innovation, and algorithms 
- Made me think about repetition and patterns and temporal significances
- Was about the artist’s inspiration from nature, algorithms, and systems 
- Made me think about “crafts as informing emerging technologies”
- Was about challenges faced by the artist while translating physical and virtual fabrication (all about weaves and pixels)
- Was about challenges faced while trying to communicate the perspective of crafting 

In addition to guiding me move forward with my Thesis, I am more than gruntled to have recollections and records of these enthralling conversations to come back to in time of need for inspiration and encouragement.
