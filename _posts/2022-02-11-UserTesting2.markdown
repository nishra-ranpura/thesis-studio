### Unnecessary Inventions

**Rapid prototyping of collective intelligence**

1. (2 minutes) Introduction of the rules (not the thesis)
2. (5 minutes) Participants will individually pull out two or three (or more) pieces of paper from a bowl. They have random names of machines (biotic and abiotic) written on them. Participants will have 5 minutes to speculate on what the intelligences of each machine might be and what will a collective intelligence of those two/three machines look like. They can write or sketch the idea or be even more creative.
3. (10 minutes) repeat the process individually
4. (8 minutes) repeat the process as a group
5. (10 minutes) Shareback and Wrap-up

**_Materials needed:_** Machine name chits, a bowl, blank pieces of paper, pens/pencils

**_Purpose:_** Testing the notion of collective intelligence by thinking of innovative inventions based on a bizarre combination of random objects

**_Reflections:_** This was a really fun exercise for rapid prototyping. What hybrid inventions can you conjure up in a short amount of time with a combination of bizzare objects such as a milk and a computer, or water and arduino, or a mosquito and a computer? Participants were quick with the inventions with low risk of thinking about limitations or practicality. It certainly made me think about how often we limit ourselves to fit the accepted standards of usable designs. It also made me understand what people think of an objectâ€™s intelligence, and how it is far from form and aesthetics, and goes deep into function and interaction.
