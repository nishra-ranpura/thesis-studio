_This piece of writing is strongly an attempt to think out loud._

My research is about making sense of this ambiguous notion that is the world of technology. How we interact with and understand different technologies sets the tone for future iterations of those technologies. And today, while we race to socially, politically, judicially, economically, keep up with the progress of these technologies, how much attention are we paying to where it is going and where it is coming from? How well do we understand the technologies before we try to solve the problems behind them? This time right now when the research began and when it is developing, a time amidst the Covid Pandemic, is a pivotal moment in terms of our interactions with ourselves, and the technologies around us. Finding comfort in nostalgia and the primordial urge to sense (and create) are some of the key ingredients I am tapping into for this research. And, to avoid speaking on behalf of agencies out of my power, and taking a more introspective take on these key ingredients, for a more phenomenological experience, I reflect upon my own patterns of interacting with technologies based on my affinities towards crafting as a means of understanding.

**Working Concept Statement**

I am trying to research how to understand design and technology, through my affinitive lens of crafts, and what a perspective as such might mean to the field of technology. I am trying to make one and several provocative hypotheses about this complex relationship that is between crafting and technology. These hypotheses are meant to be thought provoking, questioning, challenging, reaching, and even absurd. What they are not meant to be are definitive and conclusive. 



**Ideas in form**

After struggling for weeks to understand my own drive and expectations behind this research, I have come to this realization that I am just looking to build my own personal library. Hence, I came up with this metaphor of my personal bookshelf, as an answer to, ‘What is the form for this thesis?’

Just like a personal bookshelf, my thesis is to create this collection of hypotheses, in the form of anything from art, experiment, tool, academic paper, or something else. But this collection is mine and for me to refer to. Sure, a lot of people have the same objects (like different copies of the same book), but the object in my shelf is my reference and experience, and someone else can come and browse and borrow for their own experience and inspiration. 

**Ideas in form: macro**

To give a bit more structure to this rich array or possibilities while relating crafting and technologies, I tried to compartmentalise the scope (just like dedicating shelves on a bookshelf):
1. Looking at literature, philosophies, and metaphors of crafting in technology
2. Looking at practical application and techniques
3. Self’s experience
4. Critiquing the relationship between craft and technology
5. And, looking at absence of connection

I started exploring the specific nature of these objects that will fill up my shelf, and that’s where some of the below prototypes were made for:

_Provocation_: What role does understanding play in the politics and poetics of care of a technology/machine?

_Provocation_: What are the applications of weave variations in a circuit routing system?

_Provocation_: What can we derive from the parallels between computing languages and the repetitive process of weaving on a loom?

_Provocation_: A dialogue around inclusion in technology with a multi-layer fabric as a metaphor of something that is structurally binary (while being constructed on a machine), but has multiple layers in meaning.

_Provocation_: Multi-sensory approach towards Motion Sensing

![Loom Test](/thesis-studio/assets/loomtest.png){:class="img-responsive"}


While these were low-fidelity exercises to translate the abstractness of my thoughts, I do see my final thesis (the bookshelf) to be refined and high-fidelity versions of such experiments and explorations as a provocation towards looking at technology from a new light.

What might be a collective form? I don't know yet. These could be an actual physical shelf with these articles on them as a display, or could be in the form of a collection of individual research papers, or could be similar to  a conference or a symposium where different speakers talk about different connections but have a similar underlying theme, or the final form could be something else entirely. It is something I am still ideating on.
