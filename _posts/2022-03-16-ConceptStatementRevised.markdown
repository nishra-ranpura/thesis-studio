_Thinking through textiles (TTT)_ is a design inquiry and a conversation that traverses the arena of collective intelligence through theories, philosophies, and applications of textiles. It is a critically fabulated narrative of the researcherâ€™s intellectual journey through her lens of understanding textiles, where, by means of a collection of digital and physical artifacts, and speculative investigations, she questions and rethinks the socio-cultural, technological, pedagogical, and metaphysical systems around self.

Thinking through textiles, as an advocate of collective intelligence, hopes to evoke conversations around alternative and plural perspectives of systems and interactions, for instance, thinking about politics of time and temporalities through various modalities of weaving, thinking about the parallels between literary / computational languages and woven linearity, thinking about healing and regeneration through fabric structures and weaves, thinking about motion, simulation and animation technologies through multi-dimensional woven fabrication, and so on.
