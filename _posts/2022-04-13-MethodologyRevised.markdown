#### Since the research is auto-ethnographic in nature, what if the written thesis was in the form of a memoir? What would the Methodology look like then?


_“The greatest invention of the nineteenth century was the invention of the method of invention. A new method entered into life. In order to understand our epoch, we can neglect all the details of change, such as railways, telegraphs, radios, spinning machines, synthetic dyes. We must concentrate on the method itself; that is the real novelty...” 
[Alfred North Whitehead in ‘Science and the Modern World’]_

Growing up, and even now, I have always had a mini-library of my own. And it truly is that- a library and not just any ordinary bookshelf. I collect my experiences in these libraries that I can go back to and refer to, experiences such as books I read, want to read, or should read but never do, a generation of cameras, a wooden carved bike, first hand-made fabric, a swatchbook of wallpapers, an unsolved puzzle, a spinning wheel, a broken phone screen, an abandoned shoe, and I can keep going on. The purpose of these is not nostalgic remembrance but making a note of an experience that sparked a thought or feeling, because that is what one’s individual contribution turns out to be in a collaborative and collective environment, the spark. (This is not one of my strongest analogies- sparks with books? But as I mentioned in the beginning, I am simply thinking out loud here). It is not an archive only for me to look into, but just as a personal library, anyone can come in, browse through, borrow, or add to these experiences. Hence, I often bring this practice into my research as well– making space for a myriad of perspectives to share. 

_“Motorola, a success story, developed what it called a ‘‘technology shelf,’’ created by a small group of engineers, on which were placed possible technical solutions that other teams might use in the future; rather than trying to solve the problem outright, it developed tools whose immediate value was not clear. ” 
[Sennett, Richard. “The Craftsman”. Yale University Press, 2008]_

This to me feels like an apt example of how I explore plural and alternative perspectives through my practice– present thoughts and provocations whose immediate value is not yet clear. 

I contemplate over musings in the domains of metaphysical and experiential interfaces, technological interfaces, socio-cultural interfaces, and pedagogical interfaces. These musings are– philosophies of time and labor, linguistics and semantics, culture of tools, community of machines, dimensional fabrication, visibility in technology, philosophies of regeneration and repair, neuroplastic fabrication, and material study in the physical and the visual. And what do any of these mean, you ask? It is a page-turner. (no, really, I have expanded upon it in the succeeding pages). 

**Metaphysical interfaces**

Metaphysical interfaces often lead to philosophical theories and set the groundwork for conceptual inspiration for new technologies, services, products, or systems. One’s perception of an abstract or metaphysical notion influences the future. Hence, it is essential to understand the interactions with metaphysical interfaces.

- Repair and Regeneration 
Research: Woven and digital artifacts 

- Neuroplastic Fabrication 
Research: Woven artifact 

**Technological interfaces**

It is no news that textile patterns, production processes and structures have huge potential in technological applications. I simply attempt to contribute to the same beliefs and learn about our interactions with these technological interfaces.

- Visibility in Technology

**Socio-cultural interfaces**

It is not unknown that the planet is leading towards a post-human future. With machines, trees, animals, rivers, rocks, and bacteria getting a seat on the table, where are we going with the human made construct of society, culture, and community? 

- Culture of Tools 
Speculation: Digital artifacts 

- Community of Machines 
Speculation: Exploratory artifacts 

**Pedagogical interfaces**

The way we interact, and understand has a lot to do with the way we learn. We have countless studies around child development that are about this. I find it interesting to learn how we learn. The engagement, time, complexity, diversity and infinite potential that come with textile fabrication are a rich source of pedagogical behavioral observations and ponderings.

### Form

A dialogue, a conversation, or a display?

1. A formal presentation at a (fictional) conference about Collective Intelligence to talk about the work can have space for voicing the research as well as have Q&As and discussions amongst an audience from academic and scholarly background. 
2. An informal conversation like an unconference or a seminar talk for an hour or two amongst a small group of experts and enthusiasts of the field can have space for in-depth discussions and exchange of ideas, a display of collective intelligence. 
3. An exhibition, a bookshelf displaying and showcasing the various artifacts so the audience can interact with the objects as per their liking and interests.
