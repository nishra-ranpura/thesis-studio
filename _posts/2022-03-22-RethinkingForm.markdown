The collection of artifacts that expresses the notion of collective intelligence is in the form of an archive or a library, like a bookshelf. In fact, it is inspired from my relation and interaction with my personal libraries. And it makes sense to me for the research as well. A collection of information and experiences to refer to when needed. So, In order to understand this notion called library– its meaning, function and purpose, I am going to look closely into mine, to see what it contains, why it has the things it has, and what they mean to me. Why is it organized in the way it is? 

**First glance**

_Mine:_ What I see are the stories behind how I came across each book, game, puzzle, or a swatch. The yellow Mario bros. lego set can be opened and closed, so I always keep changing it while passing through. The New York skyline lego set keeps changing so I am always trying to align it whenever I lay my eyes on it. It makes my room feel more mine, and I have inside jokes and conversations with my belongings. I think it reminds me of enjoyable times whenever I find myself being lost in the everyday hustle and bustle. 

_Others’:_ I invited a few friends over to see what they see, and what they see at their first glance reflects a lot about their personalities and interests. I’ve been asked how I got all the lego sets, and what all games I have, by friends who are often looking to do fun activities and are actively involved in engaging hobbies. Some are interested in how I got hold of some books. There are always giggles on noticing the toy boxie in the middle shelf. I have noticed that the diverse objects that are there initiate conversations. 

**Organization: Looking back at my decisions to organize it the way it is**

Accessibility of the books was my first thought, since this is an approximately 4’ shelf, I was certain I wanted the books on the top shelf. The entrance door is towards the right, so having the books lean on the left so they are visible seemed like a natural instinct. The fabric swatch hanging has a personal significance, and I preferred for it to be visible, hence the hanging placement, and not the folding approach. The books beneath the swatch are diaries and sketchbooks which I prefer to keep close but not available for everyone, hence it seemed to work out. I don’t have enough books to fill the shelf, which made me keep the games. Again, the second shelf is for accessibility as compared to the bottom one. The bottom shelf is a default arrangement after what was prioritized. 
Diving a little deeper into individual shelves…
Shelftop- The varying sizes of the puzzles and lego sets make this place appropriate for them. There is also freedom of visibility around the pieces. The visual surely gets top-heavy, and the focus ends up being on the yellow Mario Bros. lego set due to its size and color. 

**First shelf:** As mentioned before, the placement of the books on the left is due to the fact that the entrance of the room is towards the right and this arrangement makes the books more visible. The books, to my own surprise, are not arranged in any particular order, other than some heavy ones in the corner. I know, book arrangement is a controversial matter! I usually arrange books according to genres and then as per author names, and usually have a favorites section that is more focused. However, I am still building my library here, and do not have enough books and genres to divide, however I still can think of arranging them as per author, size or color. But the fact that these are the books I have picked up from the sidewalks or have received from friends, and I did not go looking to buy them (most of them) intentionally, I find it hard to plan a structure. But there are some interesting books on there. There is a Romanian spell book, a book of visual poetry with the most beautiful typography and papers, a book on bicycle repair (I don’t even have a bicycle, but am always curious to know about all the mechanical parts), and a book on humans and electricity wittily named The spark of Life. One of them is secretly a locker and not even a book! Shhh… It made me realize, I did not judge a book by its cover, but certainly picked them based on their titles! The growing collection makes the space for the swatch on the right a little flexible for now, but I will have to rearrange soon if the collection keeps growing. It also worries me that my library will look more dull and less interesting!

**Middle shelf:** I have always had a soft spot for card and board games, and certainly the classic ones. Here we have Monopoly, Uno, Jenga, along with some friend-recommended other card games. I am nowhere close to the kind of collection I would like, but this is a start. I am still waiting on having a perfect group of friends with whom I can have game nights with. But for now, occasional ones seem just as enjoyable. Since the shelf seemed to be about play, there is the toy boxie that I made inspired by moving boxes because I had to make one for a school project while I was moving! Backstories are always fun! My diaries and sketchbooks lie discreetly in the corner, accessible but people probably will not pick those intentionally over other artifacts unless intentionally. 

**Bottom shelf:** This has the things I might need but not so much, and have never in fact used them. Don’t we all have shelves and drawers and cupboards like those? There is a chalk box for the blackboard in my room, and some swatch files and swatches. 

Thinking about the arrangement, I now notice the alternate play-work-play-work layout of the library, and how the shelves themselves are divided based on accessibility. It is surprising to me that a lot of the organization decisions are intentional. I am always looking for how one interacts with an archive. Is it based on interests or accessibility? What might be other factors?
