_(Work in progress) Thinking out loud about the implementation of Thesis Research ‘Thinking through Textiles’_

_Form, Aesthetics and Meaning_

I am designing an inquiry to traverse the arena of Collective Intelligence, through my lens of understanding Textiles. A collection of artifacts, most of which of speculative nature, poses alternative perspectives and inquiries, to question and/or rethink about the systems (socio-political, technological, academic, or metaphysical) around us. 

What can be the form of an archive, a research of researches? I am looking to share my intellectual journey as a renowned researcher through an archive in the form of a bookshelf displaying artifacts of my intellectual journey. The artifacts I imagine could be in the form of:
- Experiments / Prototypes
- Research Paper
- Publication (Zine / Manual / Brochure)
- Notes / Drawings
- Interviews / Podcasts
- News article
- Course Syllabus
- Exhibition Campaign
- App / Software 

A collection of these artifacts expresses the narrative.
The idea of an archive in the form of a bookshelf is very reflective of my personal experiences and significance of my personal bookshelf in my life. Since the narrative is about my intellectual journey, it seems fitting. The artifacts have the flexibility of being raw or finished, abstract or definitive, vague or precise, just the way I ideate my sparks of an idea. The aesthetic of curiosity, a feeling of handmade, and a sense of imperfect trials is what seems like a relevant direction, along with refined research.

What does one get from the interaction with the artifacts?
