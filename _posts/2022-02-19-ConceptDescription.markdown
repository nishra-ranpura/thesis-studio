_Collective Intelligences_

We think of the machines around us- typewriters, cell phones, pens, or chairs, to be their own distinct beings, yes, coexisting and collaborating with other heterogeneous beings (biotic as well as abiotic), but there is a certain segregation. What does a pen have to do with a chair, or what does a bicycle have in common with a cupboard, or a typewriter with a watch? 

_Intelligence_

The advent of Machine Intelligence brought forth dialogues of collaborative learning- what we understand, and what we express or represent based on that learning. Reiterating one’s understanding of the word Intelligence everytime Machine Intelligence advances, some curious questions are raised about the future of Machine Intelligence. 

It might be crucial to take a step back and unpack the notion of Intelligence. Because what one picks up now might just last longer than (human) beings. 

This scope raises several questions around Collective Machine Intelligence, or a community of machines:
- To what extent are my Machines’ Intelligences manifestation of my own?
- What does a community of Machines look like?
- What is the culture of a community of Machines?
- How can we create communal Machine Intelligences, or perhaps challenge it?

Thus, my Thesis research explores these questions to pose some more specific ones around this notion of Collective Intelligences. The research intends to craft various artifacts (in the form of machines, artworks, literary pieces, tools, or something else) that proposes thought-provoking hypotheses, inspirations, questions, and failures.
