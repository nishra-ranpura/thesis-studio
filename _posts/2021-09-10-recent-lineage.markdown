Projects from the last few years that resonate with my interests, either in their subject matter, or through their application (or perhaps are just intriguing to me):

[Apprenticeship 2.0](https://digitalarchives.library.newschool.edu/index.php/Detail/objects/PC020402_2020_amgab699){:target="_blank"} | _Bolor Amgalan_\\
Apprenticeship 2.0 manifests in the form of a digital tool and a series of hand-crafted virtual 3D textile objects. Homo faber- Man as the maker is at the heart of human becoming. It not only aims to capture the intrinsic values of craftsmanship such as imperfections of the human hands by occupying a space at the intersection of human-machine interaction and embodied learning, but also creates opportunities to instill in the apprentice intrinsic values attained through craftsmanship – the enduring commitment and desire to do a job well for its own sake and awareness of resource limitations. The welcoming nature and a helping hand, as opposed to a critical view, towards the introduction of new technologies in crafts, is a perspective that can benefit the unbiasedness of my interests.

[After Image: A Computational Poem between the subject, the camera, technology, and representation](https://mfadt.parsons.edu/2019/page.html#35){:target="_blank"} | _Aarti Akkapeddi_\\
After Image is an art installation comprised of a video piece and creative data visualization both showcasing a series of experiments done with an archive of the artist’s own family photographs in relation to a larger archive of South Indian studio photographs from the Studies in Tamil Studio Archives and Society (S.T.A.R.S). Each of these experiments employs machine learning and computational techniques to sort, average, and analyze the images in order to surface semantic and visual patterns across the hundreds of images. Through the use of these techniques, the artist performatively questions the notion of collective and individual identity, and highlights the complexity of the image as a data point. The ethereal balance of personal provocation, social statement, and technological exploration draws my attention, as my inspiration often stems from spaces of personal expression.

[There is no incognito tab](https://parsons.edu/dt/there-is-no-incognito-tab/){:target="_blank"} | _Sohee Cho_\\
There is no incognito tab is a collection of visual poems that chronicles Cho’s digital footprints. Experiments with the notion of looking at complex information in a simplified manner is a crucial and underlying idea in my practices, which makes this thesis project a great reference. Furthermore, looking at this concept while moving away from the tangible crafts, but still being around arts (poetry) gives a unique perspective to my experiences with crafts. The ideas of lost information in the abstraction is also thought provoking while thinking about translation of any sort.

Other theses projects I find of relevance:

The notions of rethinking the way of thinking / seeing / understanding in the following projects make these great references:\\
[From Easy to Simple](https://mfadt.parsons.edu/2018/page.html#10){:target="_blank"} | _Andrew Cotter_\\
[Peek into the Rabbithole](https://parsons.edu/dt/peek-into-the-rabbithole/){:target="_blank"} | _Audrey Xu_\\
[Hidden Systems](https://mfadt.parsons.edu/2019/page.html#40){:target="_blank"} | _Youchung Zhang_\\
[Speculative Weeds](https://mfadt.parsons.edu/2019/page.html#7){:target="_blank"} | _Joyce Zheng_

The different types of relationships of a medium with a process / application are  good for referencing:\\

[Woven Data](https://parsons.edu/dt/woven-data/){:target="_blank"} | _Isabel Anguera_

Looking at Technology in a new light in the following projects are noteworthy perspectives:\\
