#### Collective Intelligences and Crafted Machines  _(Subject to change)_

**Why Collective Intelligences?**

We think of the machines around us- typewriters, cell phones, pens, or chairs, to be their own distinct beings, yes, coexisting and collaborating with other heterogeneous beings (biotic as well as abiotic), but there is a certain segregation. What does a pen have to do with a chair, or what does a bicycle have in common with a cupboard, or a typewriter with a watch? 

_Intelligence_

The advent of Machine Intelligence brought forth dialogues of collaborative learning- what we understand, and what we express or represent based on that learning. Reiterating one’s understanding of the word Intelligence everytime Machine Intelligence advances, some curious questions are raised about the future of Machine Intelligence. 

It might be crucial to take a step back and unpack the notion of Intelligence. Because what one picks up now might just last longer than (human) beings. 

Drawing inspiration from personal experiences, I often find myself being limited in my use of certain apps on my laptop, whereas someone else is using the same laptop more efficiently or at greater capacity or just differently. The end result- the expression or representation by our respective laptops, is an amalgamation of our respective intelligences with those of our laptops’.

This scope raises several questions around Collective Machine Intelligence, or a community of machines:
- To what extent are my Machines’ Intelligences manifestation of my own?
- What does a community of Machines look like?
- What is the culture of a community of Machines?
- How can we create communal Machine Intelligences, or perhaps challenge it?

Thus, my Thesis research explores these questions to pose some more specific ones around this notion of Collective Intelligences. The research intends to craft various artifacts (in the form of machines, artworks, literary pieces, tools, or something else) that proposes thought-provoking hypotheses, inspirations, questions, and failures. 

**Why Crafted Machines?**

The collection of said intelligences, with which I intend to experiment, is to be mine and my machines’ and my environment’s collective intelligences. My intelligence finds meaning through craft, hence a lot of the attempts to work with my community of machines will be made through philosophies of craft. 

**Play Testing / User Testing Plans**

The current state of my experimental artefacts is an abstract one with rose-tinted glasses that promises potential. However, in order to dig deeper into the possibilities and pragmatism (or failure) of the questions I pose, and provocations I raise, I will use the Play Testing / User Testing to pick more brains for their interpretation of my provocations. 
I have two potential ideas for the 35 minute long play session:

- **Plan 1: Unnecessary Inventions**

	1. (2 minutes) Introduction of the rules (not the thesis) 
	2. (3 minutes) There will be cue cards of my prototypes with their narration and provocations on them. Participants will be asked to pick a card at random, understand what the prototype is about and what the provocations are. (If needed, additional videos can be shared through the laptop.)
	3. (7 minutes) Participants will then be asked to speculate their own ideas of what they might get inspired to make/think based on the hypotheses/questions on the cue cards. Some prompts will have examples to get started (For instance a musical loom or a non-linear multi-layered programming language)
	4. (10 minutes) Repeat step 2 and 3 with another cue card
	5. (6 minutes) Repeat step 2 and 3 with another cue card, or use this as a buffer to manage delays. 
	6. (7 minutes) Wrap-up discussion / Shareback / Feedback

_Materials needed:_
	Laptop (for sharing additional information if needed), cue cards print outs, blank paper for participants to speculate their ideas on, pens/pencils


- **Plan 2: (Not that) Artificial intelligence**

	1. (2 minutes) Introduction of the rules (not the thesis) 
	2. (3 to 5 minutes) Participants will be given five dice, and a bowl full of chits with random names of machines (biotic and abiotic) written on them, which will correspond to the numbers on the dice. One participant will roll the dice (2 or 3 or 4) pick up chits of corresponding numbers, read which machines are in them and try to list down common grounds for those unrelated machines’ intelligences. If any die has the same number and a repeat chit is not there, the participant who rolled can pick any other chit in its place.
	3. (2 to 3 minutes) Shareback
	Take turns and repeat till 7 to 8 minutes are left
	4. (7 to 8 minutes) Wrap-up / Feedback

_Materials needed:_
	Dice, Machine name chits, a bowl, blank pieces of paper, pens/pencils

_Revisions ( making Idea #2 simpler)_
- **Plan 2: Unnecessary Inventions**

	1. (2 minutes) Introduction of the rules (not the thesis)
	2. (5 minutes) Participants will individually pull out two or three (or more) pieces of paper from a bowl. They have random names of machines (biotic and abiotic) written on them. Participants will have 5 minutes to speculate on what the intelligences of each machine might be and what will a collective intelligence of those two/three machines look like. They can write or sketch the idea or be even more creative.
	3. (10 minutes) repeat the process individually
	4. (8 minutes) repeat the process as a group
	5. (10 minutes) Shareback and Wrap-up


Both the ideas can result into completely rational or completely wild speculation.
