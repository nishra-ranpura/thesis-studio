Well, I am still not sure what I am looking for. To be honest, it would have been nothing short of miraculous if I knew that already. Hence, I decided to revisit the experiences (works) I enjoyed or found challenging, or even enlightening.

I mapped my works/explorations and potential ideas into the spectrum of how developed they are. Ranging from _existing_ (well-realized projects) to _intangible_ (have no idea what to do about them but the thought sounds cool), with certain _tangible_ aspects in between (where they are not fully released yet, althoughI know what can be done to make them going).

Let me give words to the projects as briefly as I can.

#### That’s what she says

An autobiographical dialogue of a textile craft ‘_Ashawali Brocades of Gujarat, India_’, where the discourse is about the feelings of the craft from the scope of its designs, community, evolution, etc. The textile craft talks about how it feels. 

#### Morphogenetic Making

If we translate our actions into textiles, and analyze their physical properties affecting the progression, can we learn more about ourselves from that progression? What can data physicalization (as textiles) and further intuitive generation unravel about ourselves?

#### Once Upon A Time in NYC

![Door](/thesis-studio/assets/door.mp4) <br>
![Pavement](/thesis-studio/assets/pavement.mp4) <br>
![Billboard](/thesis-studio/assets/Billboard.mp4) <br>
![Tree](/thesis-studio/assets/tree.mp4) <br>

If the inanimate and unnoticed parts of New York city had a voice…
On a more critical note, how can we and should we even speak on their behalf?

#### Last Words

![LastWords](/thesis-studio/assets/LastWords.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

Reliving cathartic experiences of text messages and conversations with my grandfather while he was in the hospital due to covid-19, right before he passed away. Text messages were converted into binary and then into a woven swatch reflecting upon the binary nature of weaving. It is also a dialogue about the interface of weaving versus text messages that is about scrolling, and the newest messages being at the bottom, and how weaving on a conventional loom is from the bottom. It is about this and more such nuanced parallels and analogies.

#### Lost in Translation and Material API

![LostInTranslation02](/thesis-studio/assets/LostInTranslation02.png){:class="img-responsive"}

Everything is going virtual is a gross understatement. What gets lost in translation from the physical to the visual when it comes to textiles?
If the physical properties of a material can be like an API, how does that affect the loss of translation. 

#### Through the looking glass

Thinking about anthropomorphisation of one or more elements of the ecosystem, and speculating systems in their absence or “presence as lives”.

#### Pedagogy

Muscle Memory plays a crucial role in the process of crafting. What can we learn about learning? What can we learn from Machine Learning through Muscle Memory?

#### Time Travel

Looking closely at the life-cycle of materials. How does it live? How does it die?

#### Anti-Fragility

Taking inspiration from the movement of _Anti-Fragility_ (“things that gain from disorder” and “staying in trouble”), how can one apply the philosophies of mending crafts (such as kintsugi, wabi-sabi, durries, boro, applique, etc.) onto technologies and systems?

The textile designer in me, trying to find patterns in the above areas of interests felt like these fall under three common categories: _Hyper-Narratives_, _Ethnocomputing / Ethnocrafting_, and _Crafted Pedagogy_.

I am not sure where this will take me, but forward is the hopeful expectation.
