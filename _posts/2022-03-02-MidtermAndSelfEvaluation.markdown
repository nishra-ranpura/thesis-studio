Find the midterm presentation attached [here](/thesis-studio/assets/TS_Midterm_Nishra.pdf){:target="_blank"}.

The Midterm was an important milestone for my Thesis journey, as it pushed me to get my research in form and situate myself on the timeline. The feedback from the critics gave me a peek at weak and strong points I need to focus on going forward.



\\
**Communication** | 1.5/4

_How well is the student able to express their ideas, both verbally and with other forms of communication such as: writing, drawing, mapping, modeling, pre-visualizing etc._

>Clarity of communication about my concept has been a consistent challenge, and something I have been addressing by experimenting with different presentation and narration methods. During the midterm presentation, I noticed a considerable improvement in clarity of concept and its application as compared to before. The conversation was about processes, applications, and prototypes, rather than ‘what exactly it is that I am doing.’ While communication is nowhere close to as effortless as I would like (especially the time), the grading is for progress, with space for improvement.


\\
**Critical Thinking and Reflective Judgment** | 2/4

_To what degree has the student demonstrated and developed critical thinking skills over the course of the semester? Reflective judgment not only asks the questions with concrete answers such as evaluative questions about form, methodology, materials, utility, ergonomics, aesthetics, style, cultural, experience, research, and process critique, but also attacks difficult problems of the world that require research and evidence to support conclusions that can then be offered to the fields encompassed by design and technology._

>I have been enjoying hypothesizing and contradicting the reflections and inquiries of my own research. Since my research is one where I am designing for inquiry, it leaves space open for reflection in the form of critique, contradiction, and agreement, where I do not need to shy away from the fear of failure, because every outcome is an important outcome, so this has allowed me to be fairly curious. But I need the reflection to be more academically and literature inclined. As for the clarity of methodology and application, it still feels like a long way to go.

\\
**Design Process** | 1.5/3

_Does the student’s workflow exemplify a robust design process? After identifying a design problem, do brainstorming, idea generation, analysis, conceptual research, and assessment of feasibility lead to productive testing and iteration? Furthermore, does that iteration allow for evaluation of form and methodology in ways that lead to adaptation or integration of new processes and/or thoughts?_

>Isn’t every other criteria a part of the design process at large? It seems to be going in the right direction, but in terms of developments and new updates in general, things have been slow, and needs a milestone.

\\
**Contextualization, Conclusion and Evaluation** | 2/3

Have the students been able to connect their work and ideas to historical and contemporary precedents, and to situate their work within the larger discourse surrounding ideas of design and technology? Can the student confidently synthesize several different approaches to a design problem and make conclusions of their own? Can the student evaluate their projectsʼ successes and failures?

>I am happy with the diverse context I have brought in so far, but simultaneously I am also not satisfied with it as a whole, and am looking for space where the research might feel like it belongs. Or maybe it is not a bad thing that it does not feel like it belongs. 

\\
**Integration and Appropriate Use of Technology** | 1.5/3

_Are the students making good choices about the form and type of technology they are using to express their design concepts? Are the students able to integrate technology into the conceptualization of their projects?_

>It feels like the fear of unfamiliar technology, and the fear of challenges that might come in while exploring new technology has been affecting my means of application, where I am hesitant to try new things for the fear of spending time with no useful result. While the use of Technology has been at an acceptable standard, I wish to look into a more detailed application, rather than technology as a tool.


\\
**Iteration, Production, Time Management** | 0.5/3

_Are students able to scale their projects to the appropriate time frame and technical/design resources at their disposal? Are students recording their thoughts and processes on their website so that their knowledge can be shared with the rest of the class._

>The weakest area has been time-management, which in turn is affecting iterations, and will most likely affect production.

\\
**Total** | 9/20
