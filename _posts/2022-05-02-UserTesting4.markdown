### Conversation

**How to communicate the research?**

**_Approach:_** An informal conversation like an unconference or a seminar talk for an hour or two amongst a small group of experts and enthusiasts of the field can have space for in-depth discussions and exchange of ideas, a display of collective intelligence. 

**_SetUp:_** Hosting  an Unconference on Thinking Through Textiles and inviting artists, researchers, practitioners from a field similar to my thesis topic.

**_Reflections:_** Even though the participants were small in numbers, the conversation was of a tone that I was hoping for. An intimate group of participants enabled a more candid discussion. It helped me learn which questions to ask, to whom, and how? Because the answers I get structure the research and the conversation. As compared to previous tests, this one was able to touch upon the important points in a better manner, even though not all of them. Although this felt like an introduction to the idea, it also felt like it was going towards an outcome I envisioned for this research. Can the final form of my research be a conversation? After all, it is a design inquiry.
