*Design Values: the Basics*
Below is my attempt to try out the exercise of *Design Values: the Basics*, in case there are questions I did not ask myself that need to be addressed.

How might I understand design and technology through my affinitive lens of crafting? How might we learn to learn through this? 

**_Theme:_**
The thesis is meant to be a provocative perspective that might or might not provide an inspiring take for others on understanding and interacting with technologies. But before that, the thesis is meant to be an autobiographical expression of my introspection about design and technology. 

**_Reflection:_**
Through diverse applications, the thesis is meant to reflect the abstract connections between our philosophies and our practices. It is meant to provoke questions and thoughts about one’s interactions with technologies and machines. It is also meant to reflect the process of understanding, my understanding. 

**_Point of view:_**
The experiencer is to reflect upon and question their understanding of interactions with technologies. Does it help one in being more responsible in one’s actions? 

**_Challenge:_**
I am not sure if addressing or resolving a challenge is one of the key concerns for this thesis. The experiencer’s reflection is meant to be subjective, and hence, so is the challenge, if any.

**_Perception:_**
Representation of the information for the research as of now is meant to be in the form of a collection of multiple forms, such as physical prototypes, visuals, artworks, academic papers, poetry, a tool of sorts, or something else entirely. 

**_Decision-making:_**
Decision-making is a controversial aspect for the research. SInce it is meant to be a provocation and maybe inspiration, the experiencer’s decision might not be the conventional form of a decision and might not occur in the time-frame of the experience. Maybe the only intention for the research is for the experiencer to make a decision to stop and think for a moment about the subject.

**_Context:_**
This research feels like an autobiographical journey and my expressions of understanding technology. But like a personal bookshelf, it is open to visitors who are interested in browsing. It is available to experts and enthusiasts of the field, or perhaps someone like me trying to make sense of it all. 

**_Emotions:_**
What emotion is this research meant to generate? Maybe none, or maybe just a moment of wonderment, inspiration, dawning comprehension, curiosity, or provocation.

**_Inspiration:_**
This thesis is inspired by my constant struggle of making sense of the world around me, and more specifically my journey from being a textile designer to someone entering the field of design and technology. On a non-personal level, it is inspired by one’s interactions with the surroundings (specifically technologies), speculation, and embodied learning experiences.
