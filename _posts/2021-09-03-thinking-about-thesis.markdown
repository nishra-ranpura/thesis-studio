Thinking about areas of research for Thesis seems like something that would be the most obvious yet the most difficult task to do. I know what my areas of interests and strengths are, yet do I really know that? 

In order to fathom the general direction of my thoughts, I started with a basic exercise of giving words to the abstract notions of interests in my mind. The four categories- _Tools_, _Topics_, _Audience_, and _Feels_, might help in giving structure to the ideational interests.

Getting through the getting started phase, I revisited the above process and reflected once more for a more organized (probably not) outcome.

Letâ€™s see where this takes me.
