_An attempt to give a shape to my research_
 
### Concept Statement

I am researching **machines / technologies through the lens of crafting**

in the domain of **HCI and ethnocomputing** 

so that I can find **better ways of understanding and interacting with our machines.**

My goal is to propose a solution to this problem in the form of **inquiring experiments or exercises** 

with affordances including **embodied learning, emotional interfaces, diverse and/or inclusive making, and unconventional machine intelligences,**

so that people **may develop better understanding of technologies and may also craft diverse, and more meaningful machines.**



### Research Direction and Questions
My concept statement is fairly broad and open to allow space to explore unconventional relationships between different domains. Iâ€™m approaching the research from a wider lens before narrowing it down to not limit possibilities, and allow novel applications. Some of the questions I have been pondering over, that might give an idea about my scope of research are:
- How do we rethink interfaces and interactions?
- Crafts are highly diverse based on resource availability, skills, and community practices. What might technology under the same umbrella look like? 
- How might craft processes affect applications in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligences?
- What is the future of data structures? 
- How do we really feel about a hybrid future?
- How does the future of STEAM pedagogy look like with embodied learning?
- What do we understand by mending machines?

I am drawn towards conducting a series of experiments / exercises, each one of which may address one or more research questions. The next steps could involve analysing outcomes from these explorations, and moving forward based on the outcomes. The outcomes are envisioned in the form of further inquiries and questions, successful proof of a hypothesis, failure to prove the hypothesis, concerns arising from the experiments, or, a proof of concept towards a novel application. Regardless of the nature of the outcomes, the aim is to get a step closer to understanding the technologies.
