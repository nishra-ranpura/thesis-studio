**_Interweaving Interfaces_** is a result of many trials and failures, much thinking and research, some success, a lot of conversations, and even more research.

Conversation as a form for Interweaving Interfaces felt like a missing piece of puzzle being found. And although I simply had a chance to touch upon it, and this feels like barely an introduction to the idea, I surely see now, a lot of potential in designing this conversation- a collective conversation around collective intelligence. 

The research played around with a few angles, starting from collective intelligence around machines, our relationships with machines, to my experiences with technologies. It took a while to situate my research, and a while more to communicate it. Maybe because it does not fit a predefined framework, or maybe because I was just missing out on knowing what it needed. It was always meant to be an auto-ethnographic approach, and was strongly driven by my experiences in trying to comprehend the unfamiliar interfaces. The biggest challenge I faced was to make a cohesive collection out of the dispersed dialogues. The most helpful advice I received regarding this was ‘If it is this difficult to compile, maybe it isn’t meant to be that way’, and hence I embraced the messiness. After trying and failing multiple times, I realized while I was trying to curate a meaningful collection, an assorted collection is just as much a collection. 

I feel it is still too complex for my liking, and certainly too complex to be instantly engaging especially based on our attention span in these times. Perhaps realizing conversation as a form is just the first big step, and designing the conversation is what drives it forward.
