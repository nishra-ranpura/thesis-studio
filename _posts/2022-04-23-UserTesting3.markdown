### Performance

**How to communicate the research?**

**_Approach:_** Using a narrative and a performance where these are the works of a renowned researcher who is being studied by later generations because the researcher's works contributed immensely to the field. 

**_SetUp:_** A formal presentation at a (fictional) conference about Collective Intelligence to talk about the works. This is to have a space for voicing the research as well as have Q&As and discussions amongst an audience from academic and scholarly background.

**_Reflections:_** While the presentation was not well done from my end, I received some great feedback on what worked and what did not for the audience. The setup and props used for it (fictional sponsors, for example) was appreciated. Received constructive inputs about what works and what might not regarding the visual language and interaction with the presentation deck. The details of the content were not clear, and hence it can get difficult to absorb. While I think I can have a better control in sharing any information in a format as this one, I feel it did not do justice to the complexity of the topics involved due to time constraints and a formal nature of the presentation.
