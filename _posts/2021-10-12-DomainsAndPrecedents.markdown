### Identifying Domains

It seems like a near impossible task to frame the research into defined boxes of domains, since there are topics and conversations yet unexplored. Moreover, breaking free from the established notions is a major part of the research, so I cannot stop but wonder how and why to compartmentalize? However, while the fear of limiting the research is easy to give into and a comfortable zone to stay in, the struggle to define the research areas might help with the form and direction of the research. While the research is dynamic and constantly evolving, below is an attempt to identify certain domain areas based on the standing of the research as of now.

**Design and Technology:**
Driven by my impetus of personal experience with my introduction to the arena of Design and Technology when I joined the MFA Design and Technology program at The New School, I am interested in channeling my experience of initial interaction with certain technologies and evolution of those interactions. The major goal of this is to have a phenomenological experience as a contribution to the research which is largely about making sense of technology. In addition to this, certain pieces of this domain have a larger role to play. While the arguments in the research are around transparency in technology and interfaces, the discussions surrounding feminist and intersectional design is something that needs to be kept into consideration. I am also hoping to bring in the perspective of Speculative Design and Alternate intelligences to challenge the established perspectives surrounding design and technology. While the above mentioned concepts are not the focal points of research, I am interested in having them present in essence and principles, and as a subtext, if not in the literal sense.

**Human Computer Interaction (HCI):**
An important aspect of trying to understand technology is how we interact with it, and this is where HCI comes in. While HCI is a comparatively easier domain to explore, I am equally interested in Computer-Computer interaction and Computer-Culture interaction. This is also where it is related to Ethnocomputing and Craft Literature. How we interact with the technology around us defines how we evolve, as well as how the technology evolves. I am interested in exploring the impetus behind these evolutions and thus the relationship between Humans and Computers (and other iterations of Computer relations).

**Ethnocomputing:**
A domain that at present seems to be an extension of HCI, or a more focussed area of HCI, Ethnocomputing is about looking at these interactions with technologies at micro scales. I am interested in bringing the significance of inclusivity, diversity and sustainability in the discussions through research in ethnocomputing. 

**STEAM Pedagogy:**
The overarching theme and a very straightforward language for the research seems to be leaning towards STEAM Pedagogy. The phrases I have been using, such as ‘making sense of the technology’ and ‘understanding technology’ , point towards learning, and ways of learning. While the lens of craft to look at technology seems pretty evident, it is also vague, and I am interested in exploring different ways of comprehending technologies. Can this lead to some untapped knowledge? I don’t know, but I am hoping for it to move towards a direction of transparency and accessibility in information.

**RtD- Research through Design (or art or craft):**
I am interested in this domain more as a methodology for my research, and guide the forms of experimentation and prototypes. It also speaks to this idea of morphogenetic making in relation to craft. (Morphogenetic Making: A type of making where a practitioner engages in wayfaring, where encounters with materials influence decisions and actions of where to take the design, evolving the form over time).

**Craft Literature and Metaphors in Tech:**
I do not have a phrase or academic terminology for this domain yet, but I find it fascinating to look at the language and interpretation of Craft and Technology, and derive relationships and meanings based on those. I consider this to be the basis of a philosophical perspective for the research, focussing on literature, histories, theories, and metaphors that correlate the fields of Crafts and Technologies.
