### Unnecessary Inventions

**Where are my experiments situated in reference with collective intelligence and how are they received, understood, and acted upon?**

1. (2 minutes) Introduction of the rules (not the thesis)
2. (3 minutes) There will be cue cards of my prototypes with their narration and provocations on them. Participants will be asked to pick a card at random, understand what the prototype is about and what the provocations are. (If needed, additional videos can be shared through the laptop.)\\
3. (7 minutes) Participants will then be asked to speculate their own ideas of what they might get inspired to make/think based on the hypotheses/questions on the cue cards. Some prompts will have examples to get started (For instance a musical loom or a non-linear multi-layered programming language)
4. (10 minutes) Repeat step 2 and 3 with another cue card
5. (6 minutes) Repeat step 2 and 3 with another cue card, or use this as a buffer to manage delays. 
6. (7 minutes) Wrap-up discussion / Shareback / Feedback

**_Materials needed:_**
	Laptop (for sharing additional information if needed), cue cards print outs, blank paper for participants to speculate their ideas on, pens/pencils

**_Purpose:_**
 To test how effectively is the research received, what are the challenges to understand the premises, how well can the audience grasp the concept behind the explorations?

**_Reflections:_** This was the first encounter where instead of just presenting the work, the audience were required to participate in the conversation. Since the concepts behind the explorations were dense and complex, it took longer for the participants to start thinking. It also took longer to have the conversation behind their ideas. We talked about some interesting directions language based technologies can be taken forward to, branching over the areas of installations, apps, or simply traditional learnings. It made me think of brainstorming, problem-solving, debugging exercises, pitch meetings, and project proposals. It is interesting to observe how a collaborative approach gives diverse results. The question is, did I get the outcome I hoped for? I do not know yet, but this certainly helped me see a direction.
